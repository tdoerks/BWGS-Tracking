- Filter by TSB Complete
- Filter by Extraction Complete
- Filter by Complete (finished samples)

## üìä Status Dashboard
- Visual overview of sample counts at each workflow stage
- Color-coded status cards with icons
- Total sample count
- Real-time updates

## üíæ Data Management

### Data Persistence
- Automatic saving to browser localStorage
- Data persists between sessions
- No server required

### Export Options
- **JSON Export**: Full backup with all metadata for import/restore
- **CSV Export**: Spreadsheet-compatible format for Excel/Google Sheets
  - All workflow steps in columns
  - Technician info, dates, lot numbers
  - Qubit concentrations
  - Index assignments

### Import
- Import previously exported JSON backups
- Confirmation before overwriting data
- Error handling for corrupted files

### Clear Data
- Double-confirmation before deletion
- Warning to export first
- Complete data wipe

## üîê Security

### Password Protection
- Login screen on page load
- Session-based authentication (stays logged in during browser session)
- Default password: `bwgs2025` (easily changeable in code)
- Prevents casual access

**Note**: This is JavaScript-based protection (not cryptographically secure). Password is visible in source code. Suitable for casual protection only.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Sample Actions

### View Sample
- Pop-up showing complete chain of custody
- All workflow steps with numbers
- Quick status overview

### Edit Notes
- Add observations or issues per sample
- Notes displayed inline with sample
- Editable at any time

### Delete Sample
- Remove samples from system
- Confirmation required
- Permanent deletion (cannot be undone)

## üìã Chain of Custody
Every workflow step references the previous step:
- TSB shows which BAP was used
- Extraction shows which TSB was used
- Clean Extraction shows which Extraction was used
- Indexing shows which Clean Extraction was used
- Qubit shows which Indexing was used

Reference tables in batch processing show these relationships clearly.

## üé® User Interface

### Design Features
- Clean, modern interface
- Color-coded status badges
- Responsive grid layouts
- Intuitive button placement
- Modal forms for data entry
- Real-time validation

### Workflow Guidance
- Status indicators show next step
- Action buttons only show available next steps
- Batch processing only enabled for compatible samples
- Checkboxes appear when ‚â•2 samples at same stage

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Open `index.html` in any browser
2. Enter password: `bwgs2025`
3. Add samples (single or bulk)
4. Process through workflow steps
5. Export data regularly for backups

## üìñ Tips

- **Export regularly**: Use "Export JSON" for backups
- **Use CSV for reports**: Open in Excel for analysis
- **Batch process**: Select multiple samples for efficiency
- **Add notes**: Document issues or observations
- **Search feature**: Quickly find samples by ID
- **Dashboard**: Monitor workflow bottlenecks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Data stored in browser localStorage (5-10MB limit)
- Clearing browser data will delete samples
- Export backups before major changes
- One browser = one data set (not synced across browsers/computers)
- For multi-user setup, backend database required
