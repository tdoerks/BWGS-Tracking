**Date:** October 20, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Live and Deployed

## 🎯 **WHAT CHANGED**

The E. coli workflow has been updated to include **BPW (Buffered Peptone Water)** as **Day 1** - the first enrichment step, matching the NARMS 2025 Retail Meat Surveillance Protocol.

---

## 📊 **NEW E. COLI WORKFLOW (6 STAGES)**

### **Updated Workflow:**
```
Day 1: BPW Enrichment          (NEW!)
   ↓
Day 2: MAC Broth Enrichment
   ↓
Day 2: Streak to MAC Agar
   ↓
Day 3: Pink Colonies Check
   ↓
Day 4: BAP Confirmation
   ↓
Day 5: MALDI Identification → Generate Isolate
```

### **Previous Workflow (5 stages):**
```
Day 2: MAC Broth (was first step)
Day 2: MAC Agar
Day 3: Pink Colonies
Day 4: BAP
Day 5: MALDI
```

---

## 💧 **DAY 1 - BPW ENRICHMENT**

### **Data Captured:**
- **BPW Lot #** - Buffered Peptone Water lot number
- **Technician Initials** - Who performed the enrichment
- **Temperature** - 37°C or 35°C
- **Incubator** - INC-1, INC-2, or INC-3
- **Time In** - When sample was placed in incubator
- **Time Out** - When sample was removed from incubator

### **Purpose:**
BPW is a non-selective enrichment broth that allows all bacteria to grow. It's the first step in the NARMS protocol for all pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, and Enterococcus).

### **Visual:**

## 🎨 **UPDATED KANBAN BOARD**

The E. coli Testing tab now shows **6 columns** instead of 5:

```
💧 BPW  →  🧪 MAC Broth  →  🧫 MAC Agar  →  🔬 Pink  →  🧫 BAP  →  ✅ MALDI
Day 1       Day 2           Day 2          Day 3      Day 4       Day 5
#00bcd4     #e91e63         #9c27b0        #673ab7    #3f51b5     #4caf50
```

## 🔄 **HOW TO USE (UPDATED)**

### **Step 1: Add Food Sample**
- Go to Food Testing Module → Food Samples tab
- Add sample `25KS01CB01` (Chicken Breast)
- Select pathogens (EC checkbox will be checked)
- Click "Add Food Sample & Create Workflows"
- E. coli workflow created with 6 stages

### **Step 2: Day 1 - BPW Enrichment (NEW!)**
1. Go to **E. coli Testing** tab
2. See sample in **Day 1 - BPW** column
3. Click the sample card
4. Modal opens - fill out:
   ```
   BPW Lot #:    LOT-BPW-2025-001
   Technician:   AB
   Temperature:  37°C
   Incubator:    INC-1
   Time In:      09:00
   Time Out:     17:00
   ```
5. Click **✓ Complete Stage**
6. Sample moves to **Day 2 - MAC Broth** column

### **Step 3-6: Continue Through Remaining Stages**
- Day 2: MAC Broth
- Day 2: MAC Agar
- Day 3: Pink Colonies
- Day 4: BAP
- Day 5: MALDI → Generate Isolate

---

## 📝 **TECHNICAL CHANGES**

### **Code Updates:**
- `createEcoliWorkflow()`: Added `day1BPW` stage
- `renderEcoliTab()`: Updated to 6 columns (was 5)
- `openEcoliWorkflowModal()`: Added BPW modal form
- `completeEcoliStage()`: Added BPW data capture logic

### **Data Structure:**
```javascript
workflow = {
  stages: {
    day1BPW: {completed: false},           // NEW!
    day2MacBroth: {completed: false},
    day2MacAgar: {completed: false},
    day3PinkColonies: {completed: false},
    day4BAP: {completed: false},
    day5MALDI: {completed: false}
  }
}
```

## 🔮 **WHAT THIS MEANS FOR FUTURE PATHOGENS**

All future pathogen workflows will also start with BPW:

### **Campylobacter (C1) - Future:**
```
Day 1: BPW
Day 2: Bolton Broth
Day 3: Campy-Cefex Agar
Day 4: BAP
Day 5: MALDI
```

### **Salmonella (S1) - Future:**
```
Day 1: BPW
Day 2: RVR Enrichment
Day 2: LAMP Screening
Day 3: XLT4 Agar
Day 4: MALDI
```

### **Enterococcus (E) - Future:**
```
Day 1: BPW
Day 2: Ent. Agar
Day 3: BHI Broth
Day 4: MALDI
```

**This matches the NARMS 2025 protocol exactly!**

---

## ✅ **COMPATIBILITY**

### **Backward Compatibility:**
- ✅ Existing food samples will work
- ✅ New workflows automatically include BPW stage
- ✅ No data migration needed
- ✅ Old workflows (if any) continue to work

### **Data Persistence:**
- ✅ BPW data saved to LocalStorage
- ✅ Export/Import includes BPW stage
- ✅ All existing features still work

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS**

Now that E. coli has BPW as Day 1, we're ready to add:

**Phase 2:** Campylobacter (C1) Workflow
- Start with BPW (Day 1) - already established
- Add Bolton Broth → CCA → BAP → MALDI
- Auto-send to sequencing

**Phase 3:** Salmonella (S1) Workflow
- Start with BPW (Day 1) - already established
- Add RVR + LAMP → XLT4 → MALDI
- Auto-send to sequencing

**Phase 4:** Enterococcus (E) Workflow
- Start with BPW (Day 1) - already established
- Add Ent. Agar → BHI → MALDI
- No sequencing (report only)
