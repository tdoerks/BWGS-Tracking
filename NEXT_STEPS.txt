IMPORTANT NOTES
========================================

üì± Single User Mode
   - Currently uses localStorage (browser-specific)
   - Data doesn't sync between computers/browsers
   - Perfect for individual use or testing

üîÑ To Share Between Users
   - Export JSON from one computer
   - Import JSON on another
   - OR add database backend (see README)

üíæ Backup Reminder
   - Data stored in browser only
   - Export regularly!
   - Clearing browser = losing data

üîí Password
   - Default: bwgs2025
   - JavaScript-based (not cryptographically secure)
   - Good enough for casual protection
   - For real security, add backend auth

========================================
NEXT DEVELOPMENT (Future)
========================================

When ready for multi-user:
1. Choose database (PostgreSQL recommended)
2. Build simple API backend
3. Replace localStorage with API calls
4. Add proper authentication
5. All UI/workflow stays the same!
