**Date:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** ALL 4 RETAIL MEAT PATHOGENS OPERATIONAL
**Live Site:** https://tdoerks.github.io/BWGS-Tracking/
**Password:** `bwgs2025`

---

## MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED!

All 4 retail meat pathogen workflows are now fully implemented, tested, and deployed:

- E. coli (EC) - 6 stages
- Campylobacter (C1) - 5 stages
- Salmonella (S1) - 4 stages
- Enterococcus (E) - 4 stages

---

## WHAT WAS COMPLETED THIS SESSION:

### 1. Salmonella (S1) Workflow

**Workflow Structure:**
```
Day 1 - BPW Incubation (uses remaining BPW from Day 1A)
  â†“
Day 2 - RVR + LAMP Screening
  â†“
Day 3 - XLT4 Agar (black centers confirmation)
  â†“
Day 4 - MALDI â†’ Isolate Generation â†’ Auto-Sequence
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses remaining BPW from E. coli/Campylo/Enterococcus Day 1A prep
- LAMP screening decision point (Positive/Negative)
- XLT4 typical colonies (black centers)
- Auto-generates isolate on MALDI confirmation
- Auto-sends to sequencing module
- 4-column Kanban board with red/orange color scheme

**Commit:** `e0a9dd9` - Complete Salmonella (S1) workflow implementation

---

### 2. Enterococcus (E) Workflow

**Workflow Structure:**
```
Day 1A - BPW Sample Prep (shared with EC/C1)
  â†“
Day 2 - Enterococcosel Agar (dark red/maroon colonies)
  â†“
Day 3 - BHI Broth Confirmation
  â†“
Day 4 - MALDI â†’ Isolate Generation (REPORT ONLY)
```

**Key Features:**
- Shares Day 1A BPW prep with E. coli and Campylobacter
- Enterococcosel Agar (typical colonies = dark red/maroon)
- BHI Broth confirmation step
- Generates isolate on MALDI confirmation
- **DOES NOT auto-sequence** - report only!
- Yellow warning note in MALDI modal
- 4-column Kanban board with orange color scheme

**Commit:** `65c828b` - Complete Enterococcus (E) workflow - ALL RETAIL MEAT PATHOGENS DONE!

---

## COMPLETE RETAIL MEAT WORKFLOW OVERVIEW:

### Day 1A - BPW Sample Prep (SHARED)

**Sample:** 50g retail meat sample + 250ml BPW
**Process:**
1. Add 250ml BPW to 50g sample
2. Stomach for 2 minutes at 230 RPM
3. Pull aliquots:
   - 50ml for E. coli â†’ MAC Broth (Day 1B)
   - 50ml for Campylobacter â†’ Bolton Broth (Day 1B)
   - 50ml for Enterococcus â†’ Enterococcosel Agar (Day 2)
4. Remaining BPW (~100ml) â†’ Incubate 35Â°C for 24h for Salmonella (Day 1)

**Shared By:** EC, C1, E (all use same Day 1A BPW prep)

---

### Pathogen-Specific Workflows:

#### E. coli (EC) - 6 Stages
```
Day 1A: BPW Prep (50g/250ml, pull 50ml)
Day 1B: MAC Broth (37Â°C, 24h)
Day 2:  MAC Agar (pink colonies)
Day 3:  Pink Colonies confirmation
Day 4:  BAP (typical growth)
Day 5:  MALDI â†’ EC isolate â†’ AUTO-SEQUENCE
```

#### Campylobacter (C1) - 5 Stages
```
Day 1A: BPW Prep (50g/250ml, pull 50ml)
Day 1B: Bolton Broth (42Â°C, microaerobic, 24h)
Day 2:  CCA - Campy-Cefex Agar (42Â°C, microaerobic)
Day 3:  BAP Confirmation
Day 4:  MALDI â†’ C1 isolate â†’ AUTO-SEQUENCE
```

#### Salmonella (S1) - 4 Stages
```
Day 1:  BPW Incubation (remaining from Day 1A, 35Â°C, 24h)
Day 2:  RVR + LAMP Screening (42Â°C)
Day 3:  XLT4 Agar (black centers)
Day 4:  MALDI â†’ S1 isolate â†’ AUTO-SEQUENCE
```

#### Enterococcus (E) - 4 Stages
```
Day 1A: BPW Prep (50g/250ml, pull 50ml)
Day 2:  Enterococcosel Agar (dark red/maroon colonies)
Day 3:  BHI Broth Confirmation
Day 4:  MALDI â†’ E isolate â†’ REPORT ONLY (NO SEQUENCING)
```

---

## AUTO-SEQUENCING LOGIC:

**Auto-Sequences:**
- E. coli (EC)
- Campylobacter (C1)
- Salmonella (S1)

**Report Only (No Sequencing):**
- Enterococcus (E)

---

## USER WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:

**Sample:** 25KS01CB01 (Chicken Breast from Store #12345)

**Step 1:** Add Food Sample
- Select sample type: CB - Chicken Breast
- All 4 pathogens auto-checked: EC, C1, S1, E
- Click "Add Food Sample & Create Workflows"
- **Result:** 4 workflows created automatically!

**Step 2:** Day 1A BPW Prep (shared by EC, C1, E)
- Add 250ml BPW to 50g chicken sample
- Stomach for 2 minutes
- Pull 50ml for E. coli (MAC Broth)
- Pull 50ml for Campylobacter (Bolton Broth)
- Pull 50ml for Enterococcus (Enterococcosel)
- Remaining 100ml BPW â†’ Incubate for Salmonella
- **Complete Day 1A in EC, C1, and E tabs**

**Step 3:** Day 1B Pathogen-Specific Enrichments
- **E. coli:** 50ml to MAC Broth (37Â°C, 24h)
- **Campylobacter:** 50ml to Bolton Broth (42Â°C, microaerobic, 24h)
- **Salmonella:** Remaining BPW incubating (35Â°C, 24h)

**Step 4:** Continue Each Workflow Separately
- Process EC through Day 2-5
- Process C1 through Day 2-4
- Process S1 through Day 2-4
- Process E through Day 2-4

**Step 5:** Isolate Generation
- **EC:** Day 5 MALDI â†’ 25KS01CB01-EC â†’ Auto-sent to sequencing
- **C1:** Day 4 MALDI â†’ 25KS01CB01-C1 â†’ Auto-sent to sequencing
- **S1:** Day 4 MALDI â†’ 25KS01CB01-S1 â†’ Auto-sent to sequencing
- **E:** Day 4 MALDI â†’ 25KS01CB01-E â†’ Report only (NOT sequenced)

**Step 6:** View Results
- **Isolates Tab:** See all 4 isolates
- **Sequencing Module:** EC, C1, S1 samples ready for BAP â†’ WGS pipeline
- **Reports:** E isolate available for reporting only
